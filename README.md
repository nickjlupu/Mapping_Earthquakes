# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Background
To illustrate the severity of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates, you’ll need to log in to GitHub and access the tectonic plate data from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates). You will also need to make an API call to the tectonic plate data using d3.json(), and then add the data as an overlay to the map using the L.geoJSON() layer. In addition to the streets and satelliteStreets maps, you’ll need to add a third map style of your choosing. All map styles must be added to the base layer so that they show up on the map to allow the user to change which layers are visible.

## Objectives

The goals of this challenge are to:

* Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
* Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
* Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
* Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.
